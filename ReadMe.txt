CIFAR-10 dataset I have used. It has 60,000 color images of 32 x 32 size. It is available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

I have made this project on google collaboratory.

For more details about this project have a look at my article: https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-with-cifar-10-image-classification-64ab92110d79

Note: 

While training the dataset on GOogle Colab, change runtime and select GPU for faster computation.
